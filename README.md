# p5js to .png Template

This is a template for saving p5.js animations to a png file using [CCpapture.js](https://github.com/spite/ccapture.js/)

Steps to use:
1. Run sketch.html in a browser
2. Preview the animation (default setting)
3. Click the button to restart the animation and save png files
4. CCapture.js will bundle the png files and save them as a TAR file
5. After the images are extracted from the TAR, they can be converted to a video or GIF. I recommend using [ScreenToGif](https://www.screentogif.com/) for this
